## Matrix Toolbar Overview

Matrix fields are great, but working with multiple blocks at a time can sometimes be finicky and the in-built features aren't always intuitive to content editors. This plugin adds a toolbar above every Matrix field to more easily expose tools for selecting, collapsing, expanding, changing the status and deleting multiple Matrix blocks simultaneously.

## Using Matrix Toolbar

The toolbar will appear above Matrix fields and should feel pretty familiar from the Entries page and other areas of the Control Panel.

## Matrix Toolbar Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

* Make the toolbar work for Matrix fields inside global sets.
* Better handling of when new blocks are added or deleted from a Matrix field.
* Add a search field to the toolbar, so that blocks with fields that have matching results can be highlighted.
